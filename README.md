## Project overview

After completing the AWS AI Practitioner course, I wanted to test my knowledge of the services, and create a chatbot that would be used via Slack. 

These are the requirements I went into the project with:
1. The bot needed created using AWS Services
2. The bot needed to utilise GenAI for interactive discussions
3. The bot needed to link in with Slack
4. As well as GenAI, the bot needed to have access to domain based data
5. The bot must be easy to use
Bonus - If I could get the bot to work via Alexa

After reviewing the options, the following services required greater analysis:
__Amazon Kenda__
__Amazon Lex__
__Amsxon Q__

## Project planning
### __Evaluation of the AWS AI Services__

__Amazon Lex:__ Build bots with Conversational AI

__Amazon Q:__ The most capable generative AI‚Äìpowered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies' internal data

__Amazon Kendra:__ Find answers faster with intelligent enterprise search powered by machine learning
