After completing the AWS AI Practitioner course, I wanted to test my knowledge of the services, and create a chatbot that would be used via Slack. 

These are the requirements I went into the project with:
1. The bot needed created using AWS Services
2. The bot needed to utilise GenAI for interactive discussions
3. The bot needed to link in with Slack
4. As well as GenAI, the bot needed to have access to domain based data
5. The bot must be easy to use
Bonus - If I could get the bot to work via Alexa
